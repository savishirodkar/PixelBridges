Workflow:

1. Project Setup:
   Set up a project directory with separate folders for HTML, CSS, and images.

2. HTML Structure:
   Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) and set up the basic structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

3. External CSS:
   Create a new CSS file (e.g., style.css) and link it in the `<head>` of your HTML file using the `<link>` tag.

4. Tailwind CSS:
   Optionally, set up Tailwind CSS by including it via a CDN or integrating it through a build process.

5. Styling:
   Start migrating the inline styles in the HTML to classes from Tailwind CSS. Update styles in your external style.css file as needed.

6. JavaScript:
   Keep the provided JavaScript script to add the "clicked" class to navigation links. Make sure to keep this script just before the closing `</body>` tag.

8. Optimization:
   Optimize your images for web and place them in the appropriate directory.

9. Deployment:
    Choose a hosting solution (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages) and deploy your website.

10. Continued Maintenance:
    Regularly update your content, test for issues, and keep an eye on performance.
